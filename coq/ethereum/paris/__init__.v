The Paris fork transitions Ethereum from a proof-of-work consensus model to a
proof-of-stake one. This fork is often referred to as "The Merge" because it
marks the integration of the [consensus layer] with the execution layer
(defined in this project.)

[consensus layer]: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs
